This assignment was solved with the help of the following solution:
https://github.com/jiadaizhao/Algorithms-Part-II/tree/master/Week1
My solution reached 88% and the processing of the synsets need to be more accurate regarding isNoun() method
because the synsetsST contains only one string per key and not all the strings.
Any suggestions to improve the solution is highly appreciated.
